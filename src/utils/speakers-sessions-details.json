Structured Representation means Structured Context Injection. Better Context, Less Hallucinations. We walk through a couple of case studies of systems that we’ve built in production for legal use-cases - from recursive contractual clause retrieval, to HITL legal reasoning news agents.\r\n\r\nYou'll gain insights into how structured representations significantly improve the effectiveness and reliability of legal agents.\r\n",

But to cross the gap between an interesting AI prototype and an essential business tool, you need agents built by developers with real guardrails and security.\r\n\r\nThis means blending AI assistance with traditional coding in a multimodal approach that maximizes efficiency and control. The future isn't about dropping in an LLM — it requires integrating any model, any data, any system to deliver results. \r\n\r\nCompanies utilizing this approach can finally turn their slice of the $500B+ of total AI investment into real business results. \r\n",

They build from either the model out or the app layer down. But unless you start with the network layer and build up, you'll never be able to deliver realtime audio and video streams reliably. And perhaps even worse, you'll get core primitives wrong: interruption handling, conversation state management, asynchronous function calling.\r\n\r\nSean and Kwin agree on most things: old-school realtime systems people against the rest of the world. But they disagree on some important things, too, and will argue about those things live on stage. Do you need to give developers \"thick\" client-side realtime SDKs? Can you build truly great vendor neutral APIs? (You'll be surprised which of them argues which side, on that topic.)",

When you need a middle ground, it’s time to reach for the secret weapon: ontologies. These graph-shaped fragments of actionable knowledge can fill in critical gaps.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore together how ontologies bring structure, semantics, and sanity to GenAI-powered applications. You’ll learn when they’re useful, how to apply them, and what kinds of problems they help solve. Through practical examples, we’ll show how ontologies (1) guide knowledge graph construction, (2) add a semantic layer for more efficient and accurate retrieval (GraphRAG), and (3) encode domain logic you don’t want to leave up to the LLM.",

As it turns out, open-source TTS models like Orpheus have an LLM backbone that lets us use familiar tools and optimizations like TensorRT-LLM and FP8 quantization to serve the models with low latency. But client code, network infrastructure, and other outside-the-GPU factors can introduce latency in the production stack. In this talk, we'll cover the basic mechanics of TTS inference, common pitfalls to avoid in integrating them into production systems, and how to extend this high-performance system to serve customized models with voice cloning and fine-tuning.",

        "Description": "AI-powered agents promise faster, easier software delivery, but their unpredictable behavior often makes engineers hesitant to fully trust them with critical workflows. Sam Alba, Co-founder of Dagger (and previously co-creator of Docker), explains how teams can reliably integrate agents into their delivery pipelines by shifting how they structure and manage automation.\r\n\r\nHe'll share four practical strategies learned from real-world experience:\r\n\r\n1. Treat agents as workflow participants, not isolated tools.\r\nStop using agents as disconnected scripts or IDE plugins. Treating them as first-class parts of your delivery process simplifies your architecture, reduces hidden complexity, and makes agent outcomes more predictable.\r\n\r\n2. Use many small agents instead of one big one.\r\nJust as software evolved from monoliths to microservices, software delivery benefits from smaller, specialized agents with clearly defined responsibilities. Smaller agents are easier to understand, maintain, and integrate.\r\n\r\n3. Define clear environments—the real lever for reliability.\r\nInstead of chasing perfect prompts or models, focus on clearly defining the tools, resources, and permissions around your agents. Precisely controlling their environments makes agents behave consistently and reliably.\r\n\r\n4. Design workflows for easy debugging and observability.\r\nAgents will sometimes fail unexpectedly. Sam will share simple, effective ways to build clear tracing and observability into your workflows from the start, making debugging quicker and less frustrating.\r\n\r\nYou'll leave with practical, immediately usable techniques that give you the confidence to trust AI agents in your software delivery pipelines.",

        "Description": "The rapid progress in LLM capability has not translated to increased reliability for business critical AI use cases. The root-cause? Data is \"not ready\".\r\nConversational analytics doesn't go beyond the analyst team because it's hard to verify if the generated queries are actually doing what they are supposed to.\r\nRAG based systems often fail to handle the breadth and depth of real world use-cases because it requires a prohibitive amount of preparation & maintenance of an underlying knowledge graph.\r\n\r\nAgentic AI systems need to hard-code specific workflows to work reliably and end up looking more like software engineering with LLM calls instead of delivering on the promise of truly agentic workflows.\r\n\r\nIn all of these failure modes, the common culprit is that the planning or reasoning done by the LLM fails to accurately capture the user's intent or the domain's context aka the lack of a well prepared semantic data layer.\r\n\r\nEnterprise data is silo-ed and vastly varying levels of quality and the perfect \"semantic layer\" and \"metadata\" is a moving target. New data is continuously being created and business definitions are rapidly changing and often entirely on-demand.\r\nIn this talk we'll share how you can build and maintain a semantic data layer that is maintained entirely by AI, and show (with live examples) how that dramatically improves reliability of the AI system that needs dynamic access to data.\r\nWe'll demonstrate how this sufficiently augments existing RAG, text-to-SQL and tool calling techniques and starts opening the door to reliable AI deployments.\r\n",

Traditional benchmarks rarely help you understand how your LLM will perform when embedded in complex workflows or agentic systems. How can you realistically and adequately measure reasoning quality, agent consistency, MCP integration, and user-focused outcomes?\r\n\r\nIn this practical, example-driven talk, we'll go beyond standard benchmarks and dive into tangible evaluation strategies using various open-source frameworks like GuideLLM and lm-eval-harness. You'll see concrete examples of how to create custom eval suites tailored to your use case, integrate human-in-the-loop feedback effectively, and implement agent reliability checks that reflect production conditions.

Modern AI can feel like magic, but underneath the hood are principles that web developers can understand, even if you don't have a machine learning background. In this workshop, we'll explore a complete GPT-2 inference implementation built entirely in Vanilla JS. This JavaScript translation of the popular \"Spreadsheets-are-all-you-need\" approach will let you debug and step through a real LLM line by line without the overhead of learning a new language, framework, or even IDE.\r\n\r\nAll the major LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and Llama, inherit from GPT-2's architecture, making this exploration a solid foundation to understand modern AI systems and comprehend the latest research.\r\n\r\nWhile we won't have time to cover *everything*, you'll gain the essential knowledge to understand the key concepts that matter when building with LLMs, including how they:\r\n\r\n-Convert raw text into meaningful tokens\r\n- Represent semantic meaning through vector embeddings\r\n- Train neural networks through gradient descent\r\n- Generate text with sampling algorithms like top-k, top-p, and temperature\r\n\r\nThis intense but beginner-friendly workshop is designed specifically for web developers diving into ML and AI for the first time. It’s your \"missing AI degree\" in just two hours. You'll walk away with an intuitive mental model of how Transformers work that you can apply immediately to your own LLM-powered projects.",

        "Title": "Scoring models beat LLM judges any day of the week",
        "Description": "Do you wish your LLM judge was highly accurate, rapid fast, data-tunable, and continuously integrated across your stack? This talk describes a new architecture for AI metrics based on foundation scoring models and a set of integrations that run above them. This architecture was inspired by decades of AI and machine learning development in Google Search, reinvented for the modern LLM stack by our team over the past year. \r\n\r\nWe will share the history of that trajectory and then dive into the technical details: the use of encoder models trained specifically for scoring to enable higher accuracy and lower latency and the deployment of auto-generated tunable metric trees that can combine a wide variety of soft and hard signals across your stack into a human-calibrated score. We’ll end with various examples of how these scoring models are being deployed across the whole stack from online control flows for agents, to reward models for algorithms like RL, to rankers for inference time scaling methods like ensemble generation.\r\n",

        "Title": "Layering every technique in RAG, one query at a time",
        "Description": "Start with the simplest Search - in-memory embeddings with relevance ranking. End with the most complex planet-scale Search - 70+ corpus mix of token, embeddings, and knowledge graphs, all jointly retrieved, custom ranked, joint re-ranked, and then LLM-processed, at 160,000 queries per second in under 200msec.\r\n\r\nThis talk will be a fun “one query at a time” survey of all techniques in RAG in incremental complexity, showing the limits of each technique and what the next layered one opens up in terms of capabilities to handle ever-more complex queries in RAG. You’ll learn why queries like [falafel] are notoriously hard to Search over, why chunking your documents can be disastrous, how you can sometimes can get away with a simple bm25, and how some Search problems are so hard to solve that you’re better off punting the problem to the LLM or the UX. Brought to you by the team that worked on 50+ Search products, in the context of Google.com and custom Enterprise Search.",

It turns out that getting AI to click, type, and scroll is more challenging than getting it to generate code. How can we build general-purpose agents that can do anything we can do on a computer? \r\n\r\nThis is our goal at the Amazon AGI SF Lab. In this talk, I’ll propose a new approach to agents that we call Useful General Intelligence. After describing how we’re solving the biggest challenges in computer use while enabling developers to access our tech in it’s earliest developmental stages, I’ll show real workflows that developers have built with Nova Act, our agentic model and SDK.

They build from either the model out or the app layer down. But unless you start with the network layer and build up, you'll never be able to deliver realtime audio and video streams reliably. And perhaps even worse, you'll get core primitives wrong: interruption handling, conversation state management, asynchronous function calling.\r\n\r\nSean and Kwin agree on most things: old-school realtime systems people against the rest of the world. But they disagree on some important things, too, and will argue about those things live on stage. Do you need to give developers \"thick\" client-side realtime SDKs? Can you build truly great vendor neutral APIs? (You'll be surprised which of them argues which side, on that topic.)",

These were not tenable before because of the amount of customization required per customer or per scenario, and the kind of data involved in these workflows. Previously, these workflows were driven manually which were both error prone and required expensive training. \r\n\r\nTo replace or augment these manual business critical processes, automation _has_ to cross a very high bar of reliability. \r\n\r\nWe will share how we addressed the inherent non-determinism of Gen AI to create a predictable system that doesn’t have any surprising failure modes. We’ll also discuss how we worked with our existing data that was spread across various systems without an expensive centralisation and clean up effort. ",

        "Title": "Teaching Gemini to Speak YouTube: Adapting LLMs for Video Recommendations to 2B+ DAU",
        "Description": "YouTube recommendations drive nearly two-thirds of the platform's staggering 5 billion daily watch hours for 2 billion+ DAU. Traditionally powered by large embedding models (LEMs), we're undertaking a fundamental shift: rebuilding our recommendation stack using foundation models like Gemini. This talk dives into our engineering journey adapting general-purpose LLMs (Gemini) for the highly specialized, dynamic, and massive-scale task of YouTube recommendations.\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a critical first step: creating a \"language\" for YouTube videos. Learn how we developed 'SemanticID', a novel tokenization scheme that distills multimodal video features (text, audio, frames) into discrete tokens representable by an LLM. Our paper (Better Generalization with Semantic IDs: A Case Study in Ranking for Recommendations) is a landmark work in this space.  \r\n\r\nWe then adapt the base Gemini checkpoint to understand sequences of these video tokens alongside natural language, effectively teaching it the grammar of user watch behavior. A key insight: unlike static LLM training, YouTube's corpus evolves so rapidly (millions of new videos daily) that daily retraining is non-negotiable to maintain recommendation quality.\r\n\r\nNow we can prompt LRM with user history and context to generate personalized candidate recommendations, achieving the biggest engagement wins on YouTube in the last ~decade. \r\n\r\nThere’s a lot of attention on the LLM-led transformation of Search (with AI Overviews, Perplexity, ChatGPT-Search etc). However, across large consumer apps, it’s the recommendation systems & feeds that drive most consumer engagement, not just search (eg. YouTube recs drive 67% of WatchTime). This talk is about the LLM-led transformation of recommendations & feeds – building a recommendation engine on top of Gemini.\r\n",

When our customers kept hitting this wall with their RAG systems, we knew we needed a fundamentally different approach.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll share Writer's journey developing a graph-based RAG architecture that achieved 86.31% accuracy on the RobustQA benchmark while maintaining sub-second response times, significantly outperforming vector approaches.\r\n\r\nI'll survey the key techniques behind this performance leap and why graph-based approaches excel with complex enterprise information structures like product documentation, financial documents, and technical specifications that challenge traditional RAG systems. You'll learn about using specialized LLMs to build semantic relationships, how compression techniques efficiently handle concentrated enterprise data patterns, and how infusing key data points in the memory layer of the LLM lowers hallucination.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will provide practical insights into identifying when graph-based approaches make sense for your organization's specific data challenges, helping you make informed architectural decisions for your next enterprise RAG system.",

Leaders at the highest levels of the largest enterprises started asking how open source models could enhance and accelerate their AI strategy.\r\n\r\nOpen source models promise increased ownership of AI systems: control over performance and price, improved uptime and reliability, better compliance, and flexible hosting options. How are these promises playing out after months of implementation? In this talk, I’ll draw on hundreds of conversations with AI leaders at enterprise companies to discuss what has — and hasn’t — changed about enterprise AI strategy in a world where open-source models compete on the frontier of intelligence.",

I've been hacking on AI agents for a while.\r\n\r\nI've tried every agent framework out there, from the plug-and-play crew/langchains to the \"minimalist\" smolagents of the world to the \"production grade\" langraph, griptape, etc.\r\n\r\nI've talked to a lot of really strong founders who are all building really impressive things with AI. Most of them are rolling the stack themselves. I don't see a lot of frameworks in production customer-facing agents.\r\n\r\nI've been surprised to find that most of the products out there billing themselves as \"AI Agents\" are not all that agentic. A lot of them are mostly deterministic code, with LLM steps sprinkled in at just the right points to make the experience truly magical.\r\n\r\nAgents, at least the good ones, don't follow the \"here's your prompt, here's a bag of tools, loop until you hit the goal\" pattern. Rather, they are comprised of mostly just software.\r\n\r\nSo, I set out to answer:\r\n\r\nWhat are the principles we can use to build LLM-powered software that is actually good enough to put in the hands of production customers?\r\n",

        "Description": "Pinterest Search integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance relevance scoring by combining search queries with rich multimodal content, including visual captions, link-based text, and user curation signals. A semi-supervised learning framework enables scaling to large and multilingual datasets, going beyond English and limited human labels. These LLM-driven models are distilled into efficient architectures for real-time serving, with experimental validation and large-scale deployment demonstrating substantial improvements in search relevance for Pinterest users worldwide.",

Yet throughout history, the decisive factor has often been which algorithm best fits the prevailing hardware-software stack - neural networks being the classic example.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, EXO Labs co-founder Alex Cheema will share recent algorithmic improvements for running large scale AI workloads on Apple Silicon.\r\n\r\nAlex will demonstrate how the EXO Framework enables inference, fine-tuning, and training of large ML models on Apple Silicon, from the scale of one MacBook locally to clusters of colocated M3 Ultra Mac Studios.",

        "Description": "Everyone is talking about agents, and right after that, they’re talking about agent-to-agent communications. Not surprisingly, various nascent, competing protocols are popping up to handle it.\r\n\r\nBut maybe all we need is MCP — the OG of GenAI communication protocols (it's from way back in 2024!).\r\n\r\nLast year, Jason Liu gave the second most watched AIE talk — “Pydantic is all you need”.\r\n\r\nThis year, I (the creator of Pydantic) am continuing the tradition by arguing that MCP might be all we need for agent-to-agent communications.\r\n\r\nWhat I’ll cover:\r\n\r\n- Misusing Common Patterns: MCP was designed for desktop/IDE applications like Claude Code and Cursor. How can we adapt MCP for autonomous agents?\r\n- Many Common Problems: MCP is great, but what can go wrong? How can you work around it? Can the protocol be extended to solve these issues?\r\n- Monitoring Complex Phenomena: How does observability work (and not work) with MCP?\r\n- Multiple Competing Protocols: A quick run-through of other agent communication protocols like A2A and AGNTCY, and probably a few more by June 😴\r\n- Massive Crustaceans Party: What might success look like if everything goes to plan?",

We never designed our agents to handle Google Doc comments, but we tried it anyway… and it worked! The agent performed beautifully, the customer was thrilled, and I was left bewildered.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Product Management for AI agents, where roadmaps are fuzzy and we only learn the boundaries of our products after they’re released. When a product doesn’t follow predefined requirements but instead learns and improvises at runtime, PMs must give up control and lean into uncertainty, curiosity, experimentation, and fast feedback loops.\r\n\r\nThis talk is a field guide for Product/Engineering teams navigating this new reality. We’ll cover how to write specs for affordances instead of features, how to use AI evals as a product development tool, and how to perform User Acceptance Testing on undocumented emergent behavior. Most importantly, we’ll explore how to build trust with customers even when the answer is, truthfully, “I don’t know.”\r\n\r\nIf you’re managing AI-native products in 2025 the same way you managed web apps in 2020, you might find yourself A/B testing an agent that decided to go off and do C, D, and E all by themselves!\r\n",

You can use structured workflow graphs as a handoff mechanism between agents. What we've seen from the community is frankly that folks need to tinker with multiple approaches and combine primitives in interesting ways\r\n\r\nWe'll share a couple stories where teams ended up with workflow graph based approaches, a couple where teams ended up with agent based approaches, and a couple where a blended approach made sense.",

        "Description": "Your model works! It aces the evals! It even passes the vibe check! All that’s required is inference, right? Oops, you’ve just stepped into a minefield:\r\n\r\n-Not low-latency enough? Choppy experience. Users churn from your app. \r\n-Not cheap enough? You’re losing money on every query.\r\n-Not high enough output quality? Your system can’t be used for that application.\r\n\r\nA model and the inference system around it form a “token factory” associated with a Pareto frontier— a curve representing the best possible trade-offs between cost, throughput, latency and quality, outside of which your LLM system cannot be applied successfully. \r\n\r\nOutside of the Pareto frontier? You’re back to square one.\r\nThat is, unless you’re able to change the shape of the Pareto frontier.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll introduce NVIDIA Dynamo, a datacenter-scale distributed inference framework as well as the bleeding-edge techniques it enables to hack the Pareto frontier of your inference systems, including:\r\n\r\n-Disaggregation - separating phases of LLM generation to make them more efficient\r\n-Speculation - predicting multiple tokens per cycle\r\n-KV routing, storage, and manipulation - ensuring that we don’t redo work that has already been done\r\n-Pipelining improvements for agents - accelerating our workflows using information about the agent\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, we’ll understand how the Pareto frontier limits where models can be applied, the intuition behind how inference techniques can be used to modify it, as well as the mechanics of how these techniques work.\r\n",

But you can't build a domain-expert application simply by grabbing the latest LLMs off-the-shelf: you need a system for codifying latent insights from domain experts and using that to drive development of your application.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll describe the system we've built at Anterior which has enabled us to achieve SOTA clinical reasoning and serve health insurance providers covering 50 million American lives. We'll share:\r\n- how and why to encode domain-specific failure modes as an ontology\r\n- a practical system for converting domain expertise into quantifiable eval metrics\r\n- how we structure work and collaboration between our clinicians, engineer and PMs\r\n- our eval-driven AI iteration process and how this can be adapted to any industry",

Conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) methods face limitations in capturing these nuanced interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. In our talk, we introduce a novel approach integrating Knowledge Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) with VectorRAG, designed to refine question-answering (Q&A) systems for more effective information extraction from complex texts. Our approach employs a dual retrieval strategy that harnesses both knowledge graphs and vector databases, enabling the generation of precise and contextually appropriate answers, thereby setting a new standard for LLMs in processing sophisticated data.",

        "Description": "ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode isn’t interrupting just you. Interruptions, and turn-taking in general, are unsolved problems for all Voice AI agents. Nobody likes being cut short – and people have much less patience for machines than they do for other humans. Turn-taking failures take many forms (e.g., the agent interrupts the user, the agent mistakes a cough for an interruption), and all of them lead to users immediately hanging up the phone.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we use human conversation as a framework for understanding both today’s approaches to turn detection and where the field is headed. You’ll learn about how linguists think about turn detection in human dialogue, what’s working (and what’s broken) in current methods, and how we might build Voice AIs that interrupt you less than your human brother.

This fragmented approach results in delayed resolutions, repeated incidents, escalations, and dissatisfied stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis session explores an innovative solution leveraging the synergy of natural language processing from IT Service Management (ITSM) systems, Multi-agent reasoning, and dynamic context derived from live knowledge network graphs. Attendees will gain insights into an end-to-end architecture where natural language intents from ITSM tickets seamlessly integrate with experts AI agents for complex workflow tasks, supported by continuous network knowledge graph ingestion pipelines.\r\n\r\nThrough a detailed production case study, we will demonstrate how Agentic reasoning combined with dynamic network knowledge graph contexts significantly improves critical validation and workflow interactions. The showcased results will highlight dramatic improvements in ticket resolution efficiency, accuracy of network testing, and overall execution quality, delivering tangible value to both technical teams and business stakeholders.",

Learn how **containerization**, applied not just to deployment but to *each individual step* of an agent's workflow, provides the essential **isolation and environmental consistency** needed.\r\n\r\nDiscover how combining this granular container approach with patterns like immutable state management allows us to **contain agent chaos**, unlock effective testing, simplify debugging, and bring essential control and predictability back to building powerful AI agents you can actually ship with confidence.",

        "Title": "Monetizing AI: From Zero to Profit",
        "Description": "As AI continues to transform industries, companies are faced with the critical challenge of effectively monetizing AI-driven products in a way that captures value, ensures customer adoption, and scales revenue sustainably. Unlike traditional SaaS models, AI-powered products have unique complexities - such as fluctuating usage patterns, variable compute costs, and evolving customer demands, making conventional pricing strategies unhelpful to the growth of an AI product-led startup.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Alvaro Morales, CEO and co-founder of Orb, will explore why the often overlooked monetization aspect of AI is critical for businesses. He’ll share real-world examples and data to demonstrate how adaptive pricing models can drive cost savings, enhance customer experience, and reduce operational bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nAlvaro will lead a live demo, showcasing how engineers can simulate AI pricing strategies and subsequently integrate them with a simple plug-and-play solution. He’ll also share how real-world revenue simulations enable companies to test and refine pricing before implementing — reducing risk, boosting adoption, and unlocking new revenue streams. As a quick example, cloud software development platform Replit was looking to adopt a usage-based pricing model for a new product, but their existing billing system couldn't support the new model, and building a new billing system would delay the launch timeline. In order to get things done, they turned to Orb, which enabled them to make pricing changes up to the last minute. After the launch, Orb became the single source of truth for both Replit and its customers - providing usage alerts to notify Replit when users hit cost thresholds and provide insights into user spend and payment methods.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways: \r\nThe challenge of AI monetization – Why traditional subscription-based SaaS pricing models don’t work for AI-powered products.\r\nPrecision pricing – Exploring how usage-based, tiered, and hybrid pricing models can maximize revenue potential. \r\nRevenue simulation for AI pricing – Leveraging real-time data to test, adjust and optimize pricing strategies.\r\nAvoiding common pricing pitfalls – Identifying mistakes that can lead to revenue leakage and customer churn.\r\n\r\nThis session is designed for AI executives, product leaders, and engineering teams looking for actionable strategies to build adaptive, scalable pricing models that drive long-term growth and profitability.\r\n\r\n",

These present unique interface design challenges for both developer tooling and end-user experiences.\r\nIn this session, I'll explore UX design principles for multi-agent systems, addressing critical questions: What is the true configuration space for autonomous MAS? How can users arrive at the correct mental model of an MAS's capabilities, if at all? How can we improve trust and safety through techniques like cost-aware action delegation? What makes agent actions observable? How do we enable seamless interruptibility?

Jyh-Jing Hwang will demonstrate how multimodal large language models like Gemini could improve autonomous driving through unified end-to-end architectures that process raw sensor data directly into driving decisions. \r\n\r\nThe presentation will showcase EMMA's state-of-the-art performance in trajectory planning, 3D object detection, and road graph understanding, as well as another Drive&Gen research approach to sensor simulation for evaluating an end-to-end motion planning model. Attendees will gain insights into the benefits of co-training across multiple autonomous driving tasks and the potential of controlled video generation for testing under various environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nMore on EMMA here: https://waymo.com/blog/2024/10/introducing-emma\r\n",

        "Description": "Agents are all the rage in 2025, and every single b2b SaaS startup/incumbent promises AI agents that can \"automate work\" in some way. \r\n\r\nBut how do you actually build this? The answer is two fold: \r\n1. really really good tools \r\n2. carefully tailored agent reasoning over these tools that range from assistant-to-automation based UXs.  \r\n\r\nThe main goal of this talk is to a practical overview of agent architectures that can automate real-world work, with a focus on document-centric tasks. Learn the core building blocks of best-in-class \"tools\" around processing, manipulating, and indexing/retrieving PDFs to Excel spreadsheets. Also learn the range of agent architectures suited for different tasks, from chat assistant-based UXs with high human-in-the-loop, to automation UXs that rely on encoding a business process into an end-to-end task solver. These architectures have to be generalizable but also highly accurate as agents get increasingly better at reasoning and code-writing. ",

You'll witness the next evolution of software engineering—where AI doesn't just generate code, but orchestrates the entire development lifecycle.",

        "Description": "The sheer volume of data and complexity of modern scientific challenges necessitate tools that go beyond mere analysis. The vision of an \"AI Co-scientist\" – a true collaborative partner in the lab – requires sophisticated engineering to bridge the gap between powerful AI reasoning and the dynamic reality of physical experiments. This talk dives into the engineering required to build robust AI Co-scientists for hands-on research. We will explore scalable architectures, such as multi-agent systems leveraging foundation models like Gemini for complex reasoning, hypothesis refinement (inspired by the \"generate, debate, evolve\" paradigm described in recent AI Co-scientist research), and intelligent tool use. The core focus will be on the engineering challenges and solutions for integrating diverse, real-time empirical data streams – visual data from cameras, quantitative readings from sensors, positional feedback from actuators, and instrument outputs – directly into the AI's reasoning loop. I will illustrate this with concrete, technically detailed examples in chemistry (adaptive reaction monitoring), robotics (vision-guided assembly with SO Arm 100 and LeRobot library), and synthetic biology (real-time bacterial growth monitoring & interpretation). We'll discuss engineering strategies for handling data heterogeneity, latency, noise, and enabling the AI to interpret, correlate, and act upon live experimental feedback. Finally, we will touch upon how thoughtful engineering of these AI Co-scientists can contribute to democratizing access to advanced scientific capabilities.\r\n",

Stop guessing.\r\n\r\nOur study at Stanford cuts through the noise, analyzing real-world productivity data from nearly 100,000 developers across hundreds of companies. We reveal the hard numbers: while the average productivity boost is significant (~20%), the reality is complex – some teams even see productivity decrease with AI adoption.\r\n\r\nThe crucial insights lie in why this variance occurs. Discover which company types, industries, and tech stacks achieve dramatic gains versus minimal impact (or worse). Leave with the objective, data-driven evidence needed to build a winning AI strategy tailored to your context, not just follow the trend.\r\n",

        "Description": "Software is eating the world. AI is eating software. AI-powered SWE means a whole lot more software is going to be written that powers mission critical systems in the coming years, with hardly any of it written by humans. Hence, when these software systems inevitably break, it’s going to be next to impossible to troubleshoot them. Towards addressing this issue, we’ll do a product launch of Traversal’s AI, a significant step towards self-healing software systems. We will showcase how it is already used to autonomously troubleshoot production incidents in some of the most complex enterprise environments.",

        "Description": "\"Evaluation\" is one of those concepts that every AI practitioner vaguely knows is important, but few practitioners truly understand. Is \"eval\" the dataset for measuring the quality of your AI system? Is \"eval\" the measure, the metric of quality? Is \"eval\" the process of human annotation and scoring? Or is \"eval\" a third-party dataset run once to benchmark a model?\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this cacophony, this talk will provide an opinionated and principled perspective for what we actually mean when we say “evaluation”, beyond the traditional for-loop-over-a-static dataset. \r\n\r\nIn particular, this perspective draws heavy inspiration from *fuzzing*, i.e. bombarding AI with simulated, unexpected user inputs to uncover corner cases at scale. This factors into sub-problems regarding:\r\n\r\n- Quality Metric. What is the actual criteria we, as humans, are using to determine if an AI system is producing good or bad responses? How do we elicit these criteria before the human SME can articulate them? How do we, as efficiently as possible, operationalize this criteria with an automated *Judge*?\r\n\r\n- Stimuli Generation. Given a metric, how do we know, with confidence, that an AI system is performing well with respect to the metric? What data is representative and sufficient for discovering all potential bugs of an AI system? And how do we generate this complex, diverse, faithful data at scale? \r\n\r\nWe will discuss in detail the philosophy, technology, and case studies behind both problems of Quality Metric and Stimuli Generation, and how they interact in concert.",

        "Description": "As AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT help engineers generate code at an unprecedented rate, the “outer loop”—reviewing, testing, merging, and deploying—becomes more vital than ever. Studies have shown that up to half of AI-generated solutions contain bugs or vulnerabilities, underscoring the continued importance of thorough, human-in-the-loop reviews. In this talk we'll take a look at how next-gen developer tools can harness AI not just for generating code, but also reviewing it. By thoughtfully integrating AI into that fully understands your entire codebase, teams can accelerate velocity without sacrificing quality.\r\n\r\nAttendees will learn real-world strategies and best practices for establishing an “outer loop” that safely and efficiently deploys high volumes of AI-assisted code,  without compromising reliability. We’ll also discuss pitfalls to avoid when integrating AI into existing pipelines.",

Otherwise, they risk allowing unauthorized operations or sharing data users shouldn't have access to.\r\n\r\nThis means it is paramount to solve these four challenges: \r\n•Knowing who users are\r\n•Calling APIs on their behalf\r\n•Retrieving only data users are allowed to see\r\n•Managing human in the loop and authorization interaction with UI less agents\r\n\r\nWe'll demo how Auth for GenAI, Auth0's new product for AI agents, solves these in a developer-friendly and secure way, so developers and teams building AI apps  can focus on building their products. This talk is for Engineers building production AI applications, not just demos. You'll walk away with a clear understanding of where identity fits in the GenAI stack and how to build truly secure and capable agents with it.",

        "Description": "Have you ever launched an awesome agentic demo, only to realize no amount of prompting will make it reliable enough to deploy in production? Agent reliability is a famously difficult problem to solve!\r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll learn how to use GRPO to help your agent learn from its successes and failures and improve over time. We’ve seen dramatic results with this technique, such as an email assistant agent that whose success rate jumped from 74% to 94% after replacing o4-mini with an open source model optimized using GRPO.\r\n\r\nWe’ll share case studies as well as practical lessons learned around the types of problems this works well for and the unexpected pitfalls to avoid.",

AI agents are scaling at an exponential rate and soon, they’ll outnumber human developers by orders of magnitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe real bottleneck isn’t intelligence. It’s tooling. Terminals, local machines, and dashboards weren’t built for agents. They make do… until they can’t.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll share how we killed the CLI at Daytona, rebuilt our infrastructure from first principles, and what it takes to build devtools that agents can actually use.

        "Description": "AI is getting deployed without guardrails, without governance, without due diligence.  Surely this is the year we’ll see a Fortune 500 CEO fired because of a preventable AI incident.  Surely this is the year we’ll see enterprises wake up to pre-deployment evaluation and post-deployment monitoring being an urgent need.  This story hasn’t changed for a decade, but surely this is the year it will.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll cover what enterprise-level AI/ML evaluation has looked like for the last decade - what’s changed, what hasn’t, what sells, what doesn’t, and where I see things going from here on out.  Evaluation matters - we all know this - but using my experience in the trenches over the last decade or so I hope to bridge the gap between what practitioners need and what the C-suite pays for in the space of AI evaluations.\r\n",

        "Description": "The transition from experimental GenAI demonstrations to robust, production-grade systems involves significant technical and organizational complexities. Humans provide a ceiling on the true ROI of automations. This session synthesizes key patterns and practical strategies gathered from more than 200 GenAI implementations across multiple industries and business sizes.\r\n\r\nBeyond the general lessons that apply to most products leveraging GenAI, we'll cover detailed observations within three application areas: multimodal understanding and search, enterprise knowledge retrieval, and AI agent architectures. We will share real-world comparative performance data and metrics on embedding models, vector index implementations, and explore various implementation methodologies that balance performance and cost.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the session addresses organizational insights critical to successful AI deployments, such as the importance of clearly defined evaluation processes and understanding real-world user interaction challenges, highlighted by examples from healthcare environments. Attendees will gain an understanding of decision-making criteria, including the appropriate complexity of prompt engineering versus more elaborate orchestration methods, token/cost management strategies in multilingual settings, and the challenges in driving behavioral change with new UX and application interaction capabilities.\r\n\r\nParticipants will leave equipped with practical, data-supported insights for effectively navigating their own GenAI projects, including benchmarks and criteria for informed technology selection, and techniques to streamline the transition from initial concept to sustainable operational deployment. Please note, we all know this field evolves rapidly and we will mark which lessons we believe are immutable.",

At Goodfire, we're operationalizing the latest in interpretability research by building Ember: the universal platform for neural programming. Ember decodes the neurons of an AI model to give direct, programmable access to its internal representations.\r\nIn this talk, we'll share more about what's unlocked by moving beyond black-box inputs and outputs, including entirely new ways to apply, train, and align AI models. We're excited for a future in which neural programming allows users to discover new knowledge hidden in their model, precisely shape its behaviors, and improve its performance. ",

Drawing on practical examples we have seen at Every consulting in industries like finance, journalism, education, and even personally making AI play diplomacy. We’ll uncover what makes a benchmark impactful, approachable, and inspiring. You’ll see our engaging new AI Diplomacy benchmark demo, illustrating vividly how thoughtful evaluation design can excite both engineers and the wider community.\r\n\r\nYou’ll hopefully walk away inspired and equipped to define benchmarks intentionally, helping steer AI toward outcomes that truly matter.",

        "Description": "[!!Subject to change!!]\r\n\r\nLarge models are trained through mountains of data and learned reward functions, yet - quis custodiet ipsos custodes? - what exactly are those amorphous blobs of data and rewards trying to specify? Building LLMs in any domain demands both clarity of thought and the skill to communicate those thoughts precisely - not only to other humans but to the models themselves. Without either, we risk unpleasant surprises.\r\n\r\nThis talk dives into:\r\n\t•\tWhy prompt spaghetti and data gumbo inevitably collapse at scale, unleashing behaviors we never intended - while a rigorously versioned spec keeps safety, personality, and UX firmly aligned, and makes incidents easier and faster to diagnose and fix.\r\n\t•\tHow OpenAI’s public Model Spec provides a clear template, complemented by emerging “dev tools” that turn hazy human intent into precise, human-and-machine-readable policy.\r\n\t•\tHow deliberative alignment training teaches models to first read and reason about the spec, boosting robustness without inflating context windows.\r\n\t•\tPractical tactics for catching ambiguity, untangling contradictions, and preserving global consistency. Plus, techniques for verifying that deployed models truly follow the contract we crafted.\r\n\r\nResources: Model Spec (2025‑04‑11) and Deliberative Alignment, Guan et al., 2024.",
