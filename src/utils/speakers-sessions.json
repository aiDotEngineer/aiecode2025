We'll cover how to get better retrieval via both sparse and dense retrieval methods, why domain-specific reranking is essential, and how to handle ambiguity in real-world queries.\r\nWe'll also touch on how LanceDB's search engine enables this architecture by delivering low-latency, high-throughput retrieval across millions of documents of varying sizes without compromising privacy. This solid foundation enables Harvey to build a product that brings highly accurate answers to hundreds of law firms and professional services firms across 45 countries.",

        "Description": "YouTube recommendations drive nearly two-thirds of the platform's staggering 5 billion daily watch hours for 2 billion+ DAU. Traditionally powered by large embedding models (LEMs), we're undertaking a fundamental shift: rebuilding our recommendation stack using foundation models like Gemini. This talk dives into our engineering journey adapting general-purpose LLMs (Gemini) for the highly specialized, dynamic, and massive-scale task of YouTube recommendations.\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a critical first step: creating a \"language\" for YouTube videos. Learn how we developed 'SemanticID', a novel tokenization scheme that distills multimodal video features (text, audio, frames) into discrete tokens representable by an LLM. Our paper (Better Generalization with Semantic IDs: A Case Study in Ranking for Recommendations) is a landmark work in this space.  \r\n\r\nWe then adapt the base Gemini checkpoint to understand sequences of these video tokens alongside natural language, effectively teaching it the grammar of user watch behavior. A key insight: unlike static LLM training, YouTube's corpus evolves so rapidly (millions of new videos daily) that daily retraining is non-negotiable to maintain recommendation quality.\r\n\r\nNow we can prompt LRM with user history and context to generate personalized candidate recommendations, achieving the biggest engagement wins on YouTube in the last ~decade. \r\n\r\nThere‚Äôs a lot of attention on the LLM-led transformation of Search (with AI Overviews, Perplexity, ChatGPT-Search etc). However, across large consumer apps, it‚Äôs the recommendation systems & feeds that drive most consumer engagement, not just search (eg. YouTube recs drive 67% of WatchTime). This talk is about the LLM-led transformation of recommendations & feeds ‚Äì building a recommendation engine on top of Gemini.\r\n",

The agent performed beautifully, the customer was thrilled, and I was left bewildered.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Product Management for AI agents, where roadmaps are fuzzy and we only learn the boundaries of our products after they‚Äôre released. When a product doesn‚Äôt follow predefined requirements but instead learns and improvises at runtime, PMs must give up control and lean into uncertainty, curiosity, experimentation, and fast feedback loops.\r\n\r\nThis talk is a field guide for Product/Engineering teams navigating this new reality. We‚Äôll cover how to write specs for affordances instead of features, how to use AI evals as a product development tool, and how to perform User Acceptance Testing on undocumented emergent behavior. Most importantly, we‚Äôll explore how to build trust with customers even when the answer is, truthfully, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù\r\n\r\nIf you‚Äôre managing AI-native products in 2025 the same way you managed web apps in 2020, you might find yourself A/B testing an agent that decided to go off and do C, D, and E all by themselves!\r\n",

KAG: Beyond Traditional RAG\r\nProblem:\r\n\r\nVanilla RAG lacks domain-specific grounding, leading to hallucinations.\r\n\r\nManual integration of knowledge sources (e.g., databases, docs) is time-consuming.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nHP‚Äôs KAG Framework: Automatically enriches generative AI (e.g., LLMs) with structured/unstructured knowledge via a unified layer.\r\n\r\nExample: Augment customer support chatbots with real-time ERP data, CRM history, and FAQs without coding.\r\n\r\nTools: n8n workflows for seamless knowledge ingestion (e.g., SharePoint ‚Üí vector DB ‚Üí LLM context).\r\n\r\n2. Architecting MultiAI Agent Workflows with n8n\r\nConcept:\r\n\r\nOrchestrate specialized AI agents (classification, data lookup, validation) in a single pipeline.\r\n\r\nUse n8n‚Äôs visual builder to design stateful, knowledge-augmented workflows.\r\n\r\nDemo:\r\n\r\nUse Case: Resolving ambiguous customer queries (e.g., ‚ÄúMy order is late‚Äù).\r\n\r\nAgent 1: Classify query intent (NLP).\r\n\r\nAgent 2: Pull order status, weather delays, and logistics data via KAG.\r\n\r\nAgent 3: Generate personalized, grounded responses.\r\n\r\nTools: Pre-built HP AI agents + n8n‚Äôs Slack/Gmail integrations.\r\n\r\n3. Real-World KAG Case Study: Financial Compliance\r\nChallenge: Auditors need to cross-reference regulations, transaction logs, and internal policies.\r\n\r\nKAG Implementation:\r\n\r\nIngest 10,000+ PDFs (SEC rules) + SQL DBs (transactions) into a KAG-optimized knowledge base.\r\n\r\nn8n workflows auto-trigger compliance checks using AI agents (e.g., anomaly detection + policy lookup).\r\n\r\nOutcome: 90% faster audit cycles, with AI-generated reports citing exact regulation clauses.\r\n\r\n4. Tools for Enterprise-Ready KAG\r\nHP‚Äôs Code Less Platform:\r\n\r\nKnowledge Layer: Unified API for Snowflake, SharePoint, Confluence, etc.\r\n\r\nAgent Library: Pre-trained models for industry domains (finance, healthcare).\r\n\r\nBest Practices:\r\n\r\nSecurely embed knowledge without exposing sensitive data to public LLMs.\r\n\r\nUse n8n‚Äôs error-handling nodes to audit and correct AI agent outputs.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways\r\nKAG bridges the ‚Äúknowledge gap‚Äù in generative AI by automatically grounding outputs in enterprise data.\r\n\r\nn8n‚Äôs visual workflow builder enables no-code orchestration of MultiAI agents for complex tasks.\r\n\r\nProduction-ready use cases (compliance, customer support) prove KAG‚Äôs ROI in accuracy and speed.\r\n\r\nSpecial Notes for Neo4j Track\r\nWhy This Fits: While focused on KAG (not GraphRAG), the talk aligns with Neo4j‚Äôs mission to enhance AI with structured knowledge.\r\n\r\nCross-Pollination: Discuss synergies between graph-native RAG and KAG (e.g., combining Neo4j relationships with HP‚Äôs KAG agents).\r\n\r\nDemo: Live n8n + KAG workflow showing dynamic knowledge retrieval from a hybrid graph/SQL database.\r\n\r\nThis submission emphasizes your Code Less KAG framework and n8n‚Äôs role in scaling enterprise AI workflows, while still aligning with Neo4j‚Äôs focus on structured knowledge and tooling.

The things we choose to measure become self-fulfilling prophecies, guiding AI toward specific abilities and, ultimately, defining humanity‚Äôs evolving role in the AI era. Today‚Äôs benchmarks have propelled incredible progress, but now we have an exciting opportunity: thoughtfully designing benchmarks around what genuinely matters to us‚Äîcooperation, creativity, education, and meaningful human experiences.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we‚Äôll explore how benchmarks function as powerful cultural memes, influencing not only technical outcomes but societal direction. Drawing on practical examples we have seen at Every consulting in industries like finance, journalism, education, and even personally making AI play diplomacy. We‚Äôll uncover what makes a benchmark impactful, approachable, and inspiring. You‚Äôll see our engaging new AI Diplomacy benchmark demo, illustrating vividly how thoughtful evaluation design can excite both engineers and the wider community.\r\n\r\nYou‚Äôll hopefully walk away inspired and equipped to define benchmarks intentionally, helping steer AI toward outcomes that truly matter.",

        "Title": "Monetizing AI: From Zero to Profit",
        "Description": "As AI continues to transform industries, companies are faced with the critical challenge of effectively monetizing AI-driven products in a way that captures value, ensures customer adoption, and scales revenue sustainably. Unlike traditional SaaS models, AI-powered products have unique complexities - such as fluctuating usage patterns, variable compute costs, and evolving customer demands, making conventional pricing strategies unhelpful to the growth of an AI product-led startup.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Alvaro Morales, CEO and co-founder of Orb, will explore why the often overlooked monetization aspect of AI is critical for businesses. He‚Äôll share real-world examples and data to demonstrate how adaptive pricing models can drive cost savings, enhance customer experience, and reduce operational bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nAlvaro will lead a live demo, showcasing how engineers can simulate AI pricing strategies and subsequently integrate them with a simple plug-and-play solution. He‚Äôll also share how real-world revenue simulations enable companies to test and refine pricing before implementing ‚Äî reducing risk, boosting adoption, and unlocking new revenue streams. As a quick example, cloud software development platform Replit was looking to adopt a usage-based pricing model for a new product, but their existing billing system couldn't support the new model, and building a new billing system would delay the launch timeline. In order to get things done, they turned to Orb, which enabled them to make pricing changes up to the last minute. After the launch, Orb became the single source of truth for both Replit and its customers - providing usage alerts to notify Replit when users hit cost thresholds and provide insights into user spend and payment methods.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways: \r\nThe challenge of AI monetization ‚Äì Why traditional subscription-based SaaS pricing models don‚Äôt work for AI-powered products.\r\nPrecision pricing ‚Äì Exploring how usage-based, tiered, and hybrid pricing models can maximize revenue potential. \r\nRevenue simulation for AI pricing ‚Äì Leveraging real-time data to test, adjust and optimize pricing strategies.\r\nAvoiding common pricing pitfalls ‚Äì Identifying mistakes that can lead to revenue leakage and customer churn.\r\n\r\nThis session is designed for AI executives, product leaders, and engineering teams looking for actionable strategies to build adaptive, scalable pricing models that drive long-term growth and profitability.\r\n\r\n",

As users rely more heavily on these systems, evaluating their quality becomes mission-critical. But traditional metrics like precision and recall don‚Äôt capture the full picture.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we introduce a practical evaluation framework for AI-powered search, across three dimensions:\r\n- Are the retrieved sources relevant to the query?\r\n- And is the final answer complete?\r\n- Are the sources faithfully used in the generated answer?\r\n\r\nWe‚Äôll share lessons from working with search companies and present early findings from a new benchmark evaluating popular augmented AI systems across these dimensions. Rather than ranking winners and losers, we explore where different systems excel or break down, and how these tradeoffs inform product decisions.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for AI engineers and product teams who want to build trusted, high-quality AI search experiences, and need a way to measure if it‚Äôs actually working.",

In 2022, I founded Monterey AI through Y Combinator, building a tool that could generate product specs even before ChatGPT launched. We later expanded into helping companies aggregate, analyze, and act on user feedback using AI. Earlier this year, the company was acquired by Reforge, where we now serve thousands of product teams around the world, offering not only world-class product development training but also a suite of AI agents for PMs, from feedback insights and AI surveys to product coaching and synthetic users. Not joking - it's my life goal to make that simulation future come true. :)\r\n\r\nI am grateful I have had speaking experiences in a lot of events, including Cerebral Valley, Zapier AI Conference, AI User Conference, Vercel AI Night, Alameda County AI Conference, organized by the Gov, etc. ",

While this may seem obvious, more often than not that a non technical product manager is put in charge of the vision, and AI engineers shy away from more product work like talking to users. \r\n\r\nI want to give a call to arms to other technical experts who have great ideas and want to push forward with them, but are afraid that a step towards product management is a step away from AI. \r\n\r\nWhy would I be a good speaker? \r\nI am a senior civil servant in the UK Government, with experience presenting directly to the Prime Minister. I perform well under pressure, and rely heavily on my communication skills. ",

Oops, you‚Äôve just stepped into a minefield:\r\n\r\n-Not low-latency enough? Choppy experience. Users churn from your app. \r\n-Not cheap enough? You‚Äôre losing money on every query.\r\n-Not high enough output quality? Your system can‚Äôt be used for that application.\r\n\r\nA model and the inference system around it form a ‚Äútoken factory‚Äù associated with a Pareto frontier‚Äî a curve representing the best possible trade-offs between cost, throughput, latency and quality, outside of which your LLM system cannot be applied successfully. \r\n\r\nOutside of the Pareto frontier? You‚Äôre back to square one.\r\nThat is, unless you‚Äôre able to change the shape of the Pareto frontier.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we‚Äôll introduce NVIDIA Dynamo, a datacenter-scale distributed inference framework as well as the bleeding-edge techniques it enables to hack the Pareto frontier of your inference systems, including:\r\n\r\n-Disaggregation - separating phases of LLM generation to make them more efficient\r\n-Speculation - predicting multiple tokens per cycle\r\n-KV routing, storage, and manipulation - ensuring that we don‚Äôt redo work that has already been done\r\n-Pipelining improvements for agents - accelerating our workflows using information about the agent\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, we‚Äôll understand how the Pareto frontier limits where models can be applied, the intuition behind how inference techniques can be used to modify it, as well as the mechanics of how these techniques work.\r\n",

We'll show how, with just a handful of high-quality examples, you can generate, validate, and iteratively expand your dataset. \r\n\r\nThis workflow keeps humans in the loop where they add the most value (spotting inconsistencies, defining edge cases, etc.) while letting LLMs do what they do best (finding patterns, generating diverse examples, enforcing structure, etc.). The result is faster iteration and higher-quality training data‚Äîwithout tedious and expensive manual labeling.\r\n\r\nBuilding reliable agents also requires good evaluation data sets. Evaluations are critical for measuring alignment with your training objectives. Again, using agentic pipelines, you can continuously assess model performance, identify failure modes, and generate more synthetic data to further improve your model. \r\n\r\nWith this proven approach, you can train smaller models to be experts in your domain with a small amount of data in a relatively short amount of time. \r\n\r\n",

They build from either the model out or the app layer down. But unless you start with the network layer and build up, you'll never be able to deliver realtime audio and video streams reliably. And perhaps even worse, you'll get core primitives wrong: interruption handling, conversation state management, asynchronous function calling.\r\n\r\nSean and Kwin agree on most things: old-school realtime systems people against the rest of the world. But they disagree on some important things, too, and will argue about those things live on stage. Do you need to give developers \"thick\" client-side realtime SDKs? Can you build truly great vendor neutral APIs? (You'll be surprised which of them argues which side, on that topic.)",

I started building RAG prototypes out of my dorm room, and now power semantic search in production for some of the top AI and developer startups in the world. \r\n\r\nSolving search (for humans, and for AI agents) is something I‚Äôm deeply passionate about because it stems from personal frustration I experienced trying to research a history book I was writing in my spare time. Despite hours of searching on Google, I kept sourcing irrelevant results that lacked nuance, and I realized how much current search engines still fall short, especially when it comes to complex, multi-step queries. If humans are having trouble finding information online, how could a fledgling AI agent stand a chance? \r\n\r\nThis talk is about how we can move beyond keyword-based search and develop more intelligent, context-aware systems by helping agents access the high-quality data they need. Live-coding this demo keeps the thesis honest, and demonstrates exactly what changes when you evolve from keyword RAG to neural RAG.",

Rather than ranking winners and losers, we explore where different systems excel or break down, and how these tradeoffs inform product decisions.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for AI engineers and product teams who want to build trusted, high-quality AI search experiences, and need a way to measure if it‚Äôs actually working.",

        "Description": "Sean DuBois of OpenAI and Pion, and Kwindla Hultman Kramer of Daily and Pipecat, will talk about why you have to design realtime AI systems from the network layer up.\r\n\r\nMost people who build realtime AI apps and frameworks get it wrong. They build from either the model out or the app layer down. But unless you start with the network layer and build up, you'll never be able to deliver realtime audio and video streams reliably. And perhaps even worse, you'll get core primitives wrong: interruption handling, conversation state management, asynchronous function calling.\r\n\r\nSean and Kwin agree on most things: old-school realtime systems people against the rest of the world. But they disagree on some important things, too, and will argue about those things live on stage. Do you need to give developers \"thick\" client-side realtime SDKs? Can you build truly great vendor neutral APIs? (You'll be surprised which of them argues which side, on that topic.)",

Is \"eval\" the dataset for measuring the quality of your AI system? Is \"eval\" the measure, the metric of quality? Is \"eval\" the process of human annotation and scoring?

This factors into sub-problems regarding:\r\n\r\n- Quality Metric. What is the actual criteria we, as humans, are using to determine if an AI system is producing good or bad responses? How do we elicit these criteria before the human SME can articulate them? How do we, as efficiently as possible, operationalize this criteria with an automated *Judge*?\r\n\r\n- Stimuli Generation. Given a metric, how do we know, with confidence, that an AI system is performing well with respect to the metric? What data is representative and sufficient for discovering all potential bugs of an AI system? And how do we generate this complex, diverse, faithful data at scale? \r\n\r\nWe will discuss in detail the philosophy, technology, and case studies behind both problems of Quality Metric and Stimuli Generation, and how they interact in concert.",

The chasm between these perspectives kills promising AI features before they reach users.\r\nIn this talk, Chris Hernandez (Manager of AI Speech Analytics at Chime) and Jeremy Silva (Product Lead at Freeplay) share an integrated framework we've developed across product strategy and operations at a leading neo bank. You'll see how we transformed siloed processes into a unified approach that connects prototyping, evaluations, human review workflows, and model benchmarking from day one.\r\nWe'll reveal the collaborative tools we built to make trade-off decisions visible, the evaluation metrics that satisfy both business and technical stakeholders, and the governance model that enabled us to ship AI features 3x faster. Learn how to create processes where product and operations strengthen each other rather than compete, and build AI capabilities that scale beyond individual features into organization-wide advantage.\r\n",

How can users arrive at the correct mental model of an MAS's capabilities, if at all? How can we improve trust and safety through techniques like cost-aware action delegation? What makes agent actions observable? How do we enable seamless interruptibility? Attendees will gain actionable insights to create more transparent, trustworthy, and user-centered multi-agent applications, illustrated through real-world implementations in AutoGen Studio - a low code developer tool built on AutoGen (44k stars on GitHub, MIT license) and similar tools.",

I've been hacking on AI agents for a while.\r\n\r\nI've tried every agent framework out there, from the plug-and-play crew/langchains to the \"minimalist\" smolagents of the world to the \"production grade\" langraph, griptape, etc.\r\n\r\nI've talked to a lot of really strong founders who are all building really impressive things with AI. Most of them are rolling the stack themselves. I don't see a lot of frameworks in production customer-facing agents.\r\n\r\nI've been surprised to find that most of the products out there billing themselves as \"AI Agents\" are not all that agentic. A lot of them are mostly deterministic code, with LLM steps sprinkled in at just the right points to make the experience truly magical.\r\n\r\nAgents, at least the good ones, don't follow the \"here's your prompt, here's a bag of tools, loop until you hit the goal\" pattern. Rather, they are comprised of mostly just software.\r\n\r\nSo, I set out to answer:\r\n\r\nWhat are the principles we can use to build LLM-powered software that is actually good enough to put in the hands of production customers?\r\n",

        "Description": "Planning, coding, testing, monitoring‚Äîthe endless cycle that spans 10+ tools that fragment our focus and slows delivery to a crawl. Vibe coding doesn't work when you've got 10TB of code. If you just sighed, you're one of many professional software engineers trapped in the traditional software development lifecycle (SDLC) that was designed before AI could parallelize your entire workflow.\r\n\r\nBut what if you could orchestrate multiple AI agents on tasks beyond just generating code, while you focus on the creative decisions that matter?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll demonstrate how real enterprise organizations are changing their entire SDLC‚Äîgoing from understanding, planning, coding, and testing all the way to incident response‚Äîusing AI agents. You'll witness the next evolution of software engineering‚Äîwhere AI doesn't just generate code, but orchestrates the entire development lifecycle.",

I've since given a few additional conference talks ranging from technical deep dives to practical hands on advice to eng leaders about \"The New Way To Build Software\". \r\n\r\nThis talk is exciting because it blends exciting real-world demos and examples with some of the hands-on advice for how IC's and leaders should think about the coming transformation AI agents in the SDLC are going to bring.",

These were not tenable before because of the amount of customization required per customer or per scenario, and the kind of data involved in these workflows. Previously, these workflows were driven manually which were both error prone and required expensive training. \r\n\r\nTo replace or augment these manual business critical processes, automation _has_ to cross a very high bar of reliability. \r\n\r\nWe will share how we addressed the inherent non-determinism of Gen AI to create a predictable system that doesn‚Äôt have any surprising failure modes.

        "Workshop Abstract": "We've all seen website chat bots which can look up an order or answer a basic question -- but what does it take to build autonomous agents which manage long, delicate processes like multi-day medical treatments?  \r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we'll explore a workflow Stride built in partnership with Avila (https://avilascience.com/) that helps patients self-administer medication regimens at home.  The stack includes LangGraph/LangSmith, Claude, MCP, Node.js, React, MongoDB, and Twilio, and rests on a foundation of treatment \"blueprints\" which LLM-powered agents use to guide patients to good outcomes.  \r\n\r\nYou'll learn how to:\r\n-Build a hybrid system of code and prompts that leverages LLM decisioning to drive a web application, message queue and database\r\n-Design and maintain flexible agentic workflow blueprints, with no special tools (just Google Docs!)\r\n-Create an agent evaluation system, which uses LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the complexity of each interaction and escalate to human support when needed\r\n\r\nWe'll also talk about the prompt engineered guidelines and guardrails which helps agents adhere to protocol as much as possible, while gracefully handling curveballs from the patient.  Please bring questions -- we look forward to sharing our learnings on how to make agentic systems like this work in the real world!",

The vision of an \"AI Co-scientist\" ‚Äì a true collaborative partner in the lab ‚Äì requires sophisticated engineering to bridge the gap between powerful AI reasoning and the dynamic reality of physical experiments. This talk dives into the engineering required to build robust AI Co-scientists for hands-on research. We will explore scalable architectures, such as multi-agent systems leveraging foundation models like Gemini for complex reasoning, hypothesis refinement (inspired by the \"generate, debate, evolve\" paradigm described in recent AI Co-scientist research), and intelligent tool use. The core focus will be on the engineering challenges and solutions for integrating diverse, real-time empirical data streams ‚Äì visual data from cameras, quantitative readings from sensors, positional feedback from actuators, and instrument outputs ‚Äì directly into the AI's reasoning loop. I will illustrate this with concrete, technically detailed examples in chemistry (adaptive reaction monitoring), robotics (vision-guided assembly with SO Arm 100 and LeRobot library), and synthetic biology (real-time bacterial growth monitoring & interpretation). We'll discuss engineering strategies for handling data heterogeneity, latency, noise, and enabling the AI to interpret, correlate, and act upon live experimental feedback. Finally, we will touch upon how thoughtful engineering of these AI Co-scientists can contribute to democratizing access to advanced scientific capabilities.\r\n",

But what if onboarding a digital worker was as simple as uploading your pitch deck? At 11x, we built Alice, an AI sales rep that writes outbound emails with the nuance and context of a top-performing human - because she learns like one too.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll share how we built a RAG system that lets users train Alice on their internal materials: PDFs, websites, call recordings, and more. We'll walk through our ingestion flow, OCR and chunking pipeline, and explain how we leveraged different technologies and vendors to support a wide-range of file types. We'll also discuss how we leveraged Pinecone and other vector embedding technologies to drive relevant, high-performing messaging. Finally, I'll share what we‚Äôve learned running this system in production across 300+ customers and over 1m prospect interactions each month.",

Conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) methods face limitations in capturing these nuanced interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. In our talk, we introduce a novel approach integrating Knowledge Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) with VectorRAG, designed to refine question-answering (Q&A) systems for more effective information extraction from complex texts. Our approach employs a dual retrieval strategy that harnesses both knowledge graphs and vector databases, enabling the generation of precise and contextually appropriate answers, thereby setting a new standard for LLMs in processing sophisticated data.",
