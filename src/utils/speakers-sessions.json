We'll cover how to get better retrieval via both sparse and dense retrieval methods, why domain-specific reranking is essential, and how to handle ambiguity in real-world queries.\r\nWe'll also touch on how LanceDB's search engine enables this architecture by delivering low-latency, high-throughput retrieval across millions of documents of varying sizes without compromising privacy. This solid foundation enables Harvey to build a product that brings highly accurate answers to hundreds of law firms and professional services firms across 45 countries.",

        "Description": "YouTube recommendations drive nearly two-thirds of the platform's staggering 5 billion daily watch hours for 2 billion+ DAU. Traditionally powered by large embedding models (LEMs), we're undertaking a fundamental shift: rebuilding our recommendation stack using foundation models like Gemini. This talk dives into our engineering journey adapting general-purpose LLMs (Gemini) for the highly specialized, dynamic, and massive-scale task of YouTube recommendations.\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a critical first step: creating a \"language\" for YouTube videos. Learn how we developed 'SemanticID', a novel tokenization scheme that distills multimodal video features (text, audio, frames) into discrete tokens representable by an LLM. Our paper (Better Generalization with Semantic IDs: A Case Study in Ranking for Recommendations) is a landmark work in this space.  \r\n\r\nWe then adapt the base Gemini checkpoint to understand sequences of these video tokens alongside natural language, effectively teaching it the grammar of user watch behavior. A key insight: unlike static LLM training, YouTube's corpus evolves so rapidly (millions of new videos daily) that daily retraining is non-negotiable to maintain recommendation quality.\r\n\r\nNow we can prompt LRM with user history and context to generate personalized candidate recommendations, achieving the biggest engagement wins on YouTube in the last ~decade. \r\n\r\nThere’s a lot of attention on the LLM-led transformation of Search (with AI Overviews, Perplexity, ChatGPT-Search etc). However, across large consumer apps, it’s the recommendation systems & feeds that drive most consumer engagement, not just search (eg. YouTube recs drive 67% of WatchTime). This talk is about the LLM-led transformation of recommendations & feeds – building a recommendation engine on top of Gemini.\r\n",

The future isn't about dropping in an LLM — it requires integrating any model, any data, any system to deliver results. \r\n\r\nCompanies utilizing this approach can finally turn their slice of the $500B+ of total AI investment into real business results. \r\n",

It's a significant interest of mine to try to uncover patterns in how generative and reasoning models approaches Game play through traditional techniques such as reinforcement learning, but also where AI based systems have difficulties at tasks that humans naturally excel at in many cases (like reasoning through certain visual or fuzzy semantic relationships). I also acknowledge that AI is getting better at this over time, but there are still unseen challenges I believe to be surmounted.",

We never designed our agents to handle Google Doc comments, but we tried it anyway… and it worked! The agent performed beautifully, the customer was thrilled, and I was left bewildered.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Product Management for AI agents, where roadmaps are fuzzy and we only learn the boundaries of our products after they’re released. When a product doesn’t follow predefined requirements but instead learns and improvises at runtime, PMs must give up control and lean into uncertainty, curiosity, experimentation, and fast feedback loops.\r\n\r\nThis talk is a field guide for Product/Engineering teams navigating this new reality. We’ll cover how to write specs for affordances instead of features, how to use AI evals as a product development tool, and how to perform User Acceptance Testing on undocumented emergent behavior. Most importantly, we’ll explore how to build trust with customers even when the answer is, truthfully, “I don’t know.”\r\n\r\nIf you’re managing AI-native products in 2025 the same way you managed web apps in 2020, you might find yourself A/B testing an agent that decided to go off and do C, D, and E all by themselves!\r\n",

KAG: Beyond Traditional RAG\r\nProblem:\r\n\r\nVanilla RAG lacks domain-specific grounding, leading to hallucinations.\r\n\r\nManual integration of knowledge sources (e.g., databases, docs) is time-consuming.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nHP’s KAG Framework: Automatically enriches generative AI (e.g., LLMs) with structured/unstructured knowledge via a unified layer.\r\n\r\nExample: Augment customer support chatbots with real-time ERP data, CRM history, and FAQs without coding.\r\n\r\nTools: n8n workflows for seamless knowledge ingestion (e.g., SharePoint → vector DB → LLM context).\r\n\r\n2. Architecting MultiAI Agent Workflows with n8n\r\nConcept:\r\n\r\nOrchestrate specialized AI agents (classification, data lookup, validation) in a single pipeline.\r\n\r\nUse n8n’s visual builder to design stateful, knowledge-augmented workflows.\r\n\r\nDemo:\r\n\r\nUse Case: Resolving ambiguous customer queries (e.g., “My order is late”).\r\n\r\nAgent 1: Classify query intent (NLP).\r\n\r\nAgent 2: Pull order status, weather delays, and logistics data via KAG.\r\n\r\nAgent 3: Generate personalized, grounded responses.\r\n\r\nTools: Pre-built HP AI agents + n8n’s Slack/Gmail integrations.\r\n\r\n3. Real-World KAG Case Study: Financial Compliance\r\nChallenge: Auditors need to cross-reference regulations, transaction logs, and internal policies.\r\n\r\nKAG Implementation:\r\n\r\nIngest 10,000+ PDFs (SEC rules) + SQL DBs (transactions) into a KAG-optimized knowledge base.\r\n\r\nn8n workflows auto-trigger compliance checks using AI agents (e.g., anomaly detection + policy lookup).\r\n\r\nOutcome: 90% faster audit cycles, with AI-generated reports citing exact regulation clauses.\r\n\r\n4. Tools for Enterprise-Ready KAG\r\nHP’s Code Less Platform:\r\n\r\nKnowledge Layer: Unified API for Snowflake, SharePoint, Confluence, etc.\r\n\r\nAgent Library: Pre-trained models for industry domains (finance, healthcare).\r\n\r\nBest Practices:\r\n\r\nSecurely embed knowledge without exposing sensitive data to public LLMs.\r\n\r\nUse n8n’s error-handling nodes to audit and correct AI agent outputs.\r\n\r\nKey Takeaways\r\nKAG bridges the “knowledge gap” in generative AI by automatically grounding outputs in enterprise data.\r\n\r\nn8n’s visual workflow builder enables no-code orchestration of MultiAI agents for complex tasks.\r\n\r\nProduction-ready use cases (compliance, customer support) prove KAG’s ROI in accuracy and speed.\r\n\r\nSpecial Notes for Neo4j Track\r\nWhy This Fits: While focused on KAG (not GraphRAG), the talk aligns with Neo4j’s mission to enhance AI with structured knowledge.\r\n\r\nCross-Pollination: Discuss synergies between graph-native RAG and KAG (e.g., combining Neo4j relationships with HP’s KAG agents).\r\n\r\nDemo: Live n8n + KAG workflow showing dynamic knowledge retrieval from a hybrid graph/SQL database.\r\n\r\nThis submission emphasizes your Code Less KAG framework and n8n’s role in scaling enterprise AI workflows, while still aligning with Neo4j’s focus on structured knowledge and tooling.

Today’s benchmarks have propelled incredible progress, but now we have an exciting opportunity: thoughtfully designing benchmarks around what genuinely matters to us—cooperation, creativity, education, and meaningful human experiences.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll explore how benchmarks function as powerful cultural memes, influencing not only technical outcomes but societal direction. Drawing on practical examples we have seen at Every consulting in industries like finance, journalism, education, and even personally making AI play diplomacy. We’ll uncover what makes a benchmark impactful, approachable, and inspiring. You’ll see our engaging new AI Diplomacy benchmark demo, illustrating vividly how thoughtful evaluation design can excite both engineers and the wider community.\r\n\r\nYou’ll hopefully walk away inspired and equipped to define benchmarks intentionally, helping steer AI toward outcomes that truly matter.",

        "Title": "Monetizing AI: From Zero to Profit",
        "Description": "As AI continues to transform industries, companies are faced with the critical challenge of effectively monetizing AI-driven products in a way that captures value, ensures customer adoption, and scales revenue sustainably. Unlike traditional SaaS models, AI-powered products have unique complexities - such as fluctuating usage patterns, variable compute costs, and evolving customer demands, making conventional pricing strategies unhelpful to the growth of an AI product-led startup.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Alvaro Morales, CEO and co-founder of Orb, will explore why the often overlooked monetization aspect of AI is critical for businesses. He’ll share real-world examples and data to demonstrate how adaptive pricing models can drive cost savings, enhance customer experience, and reduce operational bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nAlvaro will lead a live demo, showcasing how engineers can simulate AI pricing strategies and subsequently integrate them with a simple plug-and-play solution. He’ll also share how real-world revenue simulations enable companies to test and refine pricing before implementing — reducing risk, boosting adoption, and unlocking new revenue streams. As a quick example, cloud software development platform Replit was looking to adopt a usage-based pricing model for a new product, but their existing billing system couldn't support the new model, and building a new billing system would delay the launch timeline. In order to get things done, they turned to Orb, which enabled them to make pricing changes up to the last minute. After the launch, Orb became the single source of truth for both Replit and its customers - providing usage alerts to notify Replit when users hit cost thresholds and provide insights into user spend and payment methods.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways: \r\nThe challenge of AI monetization – Why traditional subscription-based SaaS pricing models don’t work for AI-powered products.\r\nPrecision pricing – Exploring how usage-based, tiered, and hybrid pricing models can maximize revenue potential. \r\nRevenue simulation for AI pricing – Leveraging real-time data to test, adjust and optimize pricing strategies.\r\nAvoiding common pricing pitfalls – Identifying mistakes that can lead to revenue leakage and customer churn.\r\n\r\nThis session is designed for AI executives, product leaders, and engineering teams looking for actionable strategies to build adaptive, scalable pricing models that drive long-term growth and profitability.\r\n\r\n",

        "Description": "AI search is becoming the front door to information, whether through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Search-Augmented Generation (SAG), or custom agents that synthesize answers on top of indexed content. As users rely more heavily on these systems, evaluating their quality becomes mission-critical. But traditional metrics like precision and recall don’t capture the full picture.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we introduce a practical evaluation framework for AI-powered search, across three dimensions:\r\n- Are the retrieved sources relevant to the query?\r\n- And is the final answer complete?\r\n- Are the sources faithfully used in the generated answer?\r\n\r\nWe’ll share lessons from working with search companies and present early findings from a new benchmark evaluating popular augmented AI systems across these dimensions. Rather than ranking winners and losers, we explore where different systems excel or break down, and how these tradeoffs inform product decisions.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for AI engineers and product teams who want to build trusted, high-quality AI search experiences, and need a way to measure if it’s actually working.",

In 2022, I founded Monterey AI through Y Combinator, building a tool that could generate product specs even before ChatGPT launched. We later expanded into helping companies aggregate, analyze, and act on user feedback using AI. Earlier this year, the company was acquired by Reforge, where we now serve thousands of product teams around the world, offering not only world-class product development training but also a suite of AI agents for PMs, from feedback insights and AI surveys to product coaching and synthetic users. Not joking - it's my life goal to make that simulation future come true. :)\r\n\r\nI am grateful I have had speaking experiences in a lot of events, including Cerebral Valley, Zapier AI Conference, AI User Conference, Vercel AI Night, Alameda County AI Conference, organized by the Gov, etc. ",

As CTO of Thomson Reuters, he’s leading a multi-year transformation that’s redefining how millions of professionals interact with AI, especially in industries where accuracy and transparency are non-negotiable.\r\n\r\nJoel has a pragmatic, engineering-first view of what agentic systems need to be: flexible but auditable, powerful but predictable, fast but trustworthy. Under his leadership, TR has moved from early Copilot adoption (now used weekly by 80% of TR engineers) to the development of custom agentic systems used in legal, tax, and compliance workflows.\r\n\r\nHe’s led AI teams, scaled engineering orgs of over 5,000, and built internal platforms like “Open Arena” that serve 13,000+ internal users weekly—all while helping define how agentic tools should behave in production. Joel’s voice is grounded, forward-looking, and refreshingly honest about what it takes to build responsibly in this moment.\r\n\r\n\t“We’re not chasing AGI—we’re solving for the kinds of work that professionals do every day. That’s where AI can have its biggest impact, and where it has the highest bar.”\r\n\r\nIf selected, this keynote will be delivered right after the launch of TR’s agentic product suite in legal and tax, making it a timely, buzzworthy, and high-credibility perspective from a leader on the front lines of real-world AI transformation.\r\n",

Oops, you’ve just stepped into a minefield:\r\n\r\n-Not low-latency enough? Choppy experience. Users churn from your app. \r\n-Not cheap enough? You’re losing money on every query.\r\n-Not high enough output quality? Your system can’t be used for that application.\r\n\r\nA model and the inference system around it form a “token factory” associated with a Pareto frontier— a curve representing the best possible trade-offs between cost, throughput, latency and quality, outside of which your LLM system cannot be applied successfully. \r\n\r\nOutside of the Pareto frontier? You’re back to square one.\r\nThat is, unless you’re able to change the shape of the Pareto frontier.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll introduce NVIDIA Dynamo, a datacenter-scale distributed inference framework as well as the bleeding-edge techniques it enables to hack the Pareto frontier of your inference systems, including:\r\n\r\n-Disaggregation - separating phases of LLM generation to make them more efficient\r\n-Speculation - predicting multiple tokens per cycle\r\n-KV routing, storage, and manipulation - ensuring that we don’t redo work that has already been done\r\n-Pipelining improvements for agents - accelerating our workflows using information about the agent\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, we’ll understand how the Pareto frontier limits where models can be applied, the intuition behind how inference techniques can be used to modify it, as well as the mechanics of how these techniques work.\r\n",

You need better synthetic data.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll demonstrate how you can build reliable, domain-specific agents, without manually labeling thousands of samples. \r\n\r\nUsing agentic data pipelines, you can finally achieve 9s of accuracy—e.g., 95%+ accuracy on domain-specific tasks like Text-to-SQL. We'll show how, with just a handful of high-quality examples, you can generate, validate, and iteratively expand your dataset. \r\n\r\nThis workflow keeps humans in the loop where they add the most value (spotting inconsistencies, defining edge cases, etc.) while letting LLMs do what they do best (finding patterns, generating diverse examples, enforcing structure, etc.). The result is faster iteration and higher-quality training data—without tedious and expensive manual labeling.\r\n\r\nBuilding reliable agents also requires good evaluation data sets. Evaluations are critical for measuring alignment with your training objectives. Again, using agentic pipelines, you can continuously assess model performance, identify failure modes, and generate more synthetic data to further improve your model. \r\n\r\nWith this proven approach, you can train smaller models to be experts in your domain with a small amount of data in a relatively short amount of time. \r\n\r\n",

They build from either the model out or the app layer down. But unless you start with the network layer and build up, you'll never be able to deliver realtime audio and video streams reliably. And perhaps even worse, you'll get core primitives wrong: interruption handling, conversation state management, asynchronous function calling.\r\n\r\nSean and Kwin agree on most things: old-school realtime systems people against the rest of the world. But they disagree on some important things, too, and will argue about those things live on stage. Do you need to give developers \"thick\" client-side realtime SDKs? Can you build truly great vendor neutral APIs? (You'll be surprised which of them argues which side, on that topic.)",

He’ll then evaluate both applications based on task performance, relevance, and latency. With a live demo (no theory or pre-baked applications), the audience will get a firsthand look at the practical differences between keyword and semantic systems in production, and learn embedding strategies, indexing trade-offs, hybrid retrieval techniques, prompt tuning, and more.

I started building RAG prototypes out of my dorm room, and now power semantic search in production for some of the top AI and developer startups in the world. \r\n\r\nSolving search (for humans, and for AI agents) is something I’m deeply passionate about because it stems from personal frustration I experienced trying to research a history book I was writing in my spare time. Despite hours of searching on Google, I kept sourcing irrelevant results that lacked nuance, and I realized how much current search engines still fall short, especially when it comes to complex, multi-step queries. If humans are having trouble finding information online, how could a fledgling AI agent stand a chance? \r\n\r\nThis talk is about how we can move beyond keyword-based search and develop more intelligent, context-aware systems by helping agents access the high-quality data they need. Live-coding this demo keeps the thesis honest, and demonstrates exactly what changes when you evolve from keyword RAG to neural RAG.",

But you can't build a domain-expert application simply by grabbing the latest LLMs off-the-shelf: you need a system for codifying latent insights from domain experts and using that to drive development of your application.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll describe the system we've built at Anterior which has enabled us to achieve SOTA clinical reasoning and serve health insurance providers covering 50 million American lives. We'll share:\r\n- how and why to encode domain-specific failure modes as an ontology\r\n- a practical system for converting domain expertise into quantifiable eval metrics\r\n- how we structure work and collaboration between our clinicians, engineer and PMs\r\n- our eval-driven AI iteration process and how this can be adapted to any industry",

As users rely more heavily on these systems, evaluating their quality becomes mission-critical. But traditional metrics like precision and recall don’t capture the full picture.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we introduce a practical evaluation framework for AI-powered search, across three dimensions:\r\n- Are the retrieved sources relevant to the query?\r\n- And is the final answer complete?\r\n- Are the sources faithfully used in the generated answer?\r\n\r\nWe’ll share lessons from working with search companies and present early findings from a new benchmark evaluating popular augmented AI systems across these dimensions. Rather than ranking winners and losers, we explore where different systems excel or break down, and how these tradeoffs inform product decisions.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for AI engineers and product teams who want to build trusted, high-quality AI search experiences, and need a way to measure if it’s actually working.",

You can use structured workflow graphs as a handoff mechanism between agents. What we've seen from the community is frankly that folks need to tinker with multiple approaches and combine primitives in interesting ways\r\n\r\nWe'll share a couple stories where teams ended up with workflow graph based approaches, a couple where teams ended up with agent based approaches, and a couple where a blended approach made sense.",

They build from either the model out or the app layer down. But unless you start with the network layer and build up, you'll never be able to deliver realtime audio and video streams reliably. And perhaps even worse, you'll get core primitives wrong: interruption handling, conversation state management, asynchronous function calling.\r\n\r\nSean and Kwin agree on most things: old-school realtime systems people against the rest of the world. But they disagree on some important things, too, and will argue about those things live on stage. Do you need to give developers \"thick\" client-side realtime SDKs?

Is \"eval\" the dataset for measuring the quality of your AI system? Is \"eval\" the measure, the metric of quality? Is \"eval\" the process of human annotation and scoring? Or is \"eval\" a third-party dataset run once to benchmark a model?\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this cacophony, this talk will provide an opinionated and principled perspective for what we actually mean when we say “evaluation”, beyond the traditional for-loop-over-a-static dataset. \r\n\r\nIn particular, this perspective draws heavy inspiration from *fuzzing*, i.e. bombarding AI with simulated, unexpected user inputs to uncover corner cases at scale. This factors into sub-problems regarding:\r\n\r\n- Quality Metric. What is the actual criteria we, as humans, are using to determine if an AI system is producing good or bad responses? How do we elicit these criteria before the human SME can articulate them? How do we, as efficiently as possible, operationalize this criteria with an automated *Judge*?\r\n\r\n- Stimuli Generation. Given a metric, how do we know, with confidence, that an AI system is performing well with respect to the metric? What data is representative and sufficient for discovering all potential bugs of an AI system? And how do we generate this complex, diverse, faithful data at scale? \r\n\r\nWe will discuss in detail the philosophy, technology, and case studies behind both problems of Quality Metric and Stimuli Generation, and how they interact in concert.",

The chasm between these perspectives kills promising AI features before they reach users.\r\nIn this talk, Chris Hernandez (Manager of AI Speech Analytics at Chime) and Jeremy Silva (Product Lead at Freeplay) share an integrated framework we've developed across product strategy and operations at a leading neo bank. You'll see how we transformed siloed processes into a unified approach that connects prototyping, evaluations, human review workflows, and model benchmarking from day one.\r\nWe'll reveal the collaborative tools we built to make trade-off decisions visible, the evaluation metrics that satisfy both business and technical stakeholders, and the governance model that enabled us to ship AI features 3x faster. Learn how to create processes where product and operations strengthen each other rather than compete, and build AI capabilities that scale beyond individual features into organization-wide advantage.\r\n",

How can users arrive at the correct mental model of an MAS's capabilities, if at all? How can we improve trust and safety through techniques like cost-aware action delegation? What makes agent actions observable? How do we enable seamless interruptibility? Attendees will gain actionable insights to create more transparent, trustworthy, and user-centered multi-agent applications, illustrated through real-world implementations in AutoGen Studio - a low code developer tool built on AutoGen (44k stars on GitHub, MIT license) and similar tools.",

Most of them are rolling the stack themselves. I don't see a lot of frameworks in production customer-facing agents.\r\n\r\nI've been surprised to find that most of the products out there billing themselves as \"AI Agents\" are not all that agentic. A lot of them are mostly deterministic code, with LLM steps sprinkled in at just the right points to make the experience truly magical.\r\n\r\nAgents, at least the good ones, don't follow the \"here's your prompt, here's a bag of tools, loop until you hit the goal\" pattern. Rather, they are comprised of mostly just software.\r\n\r\nSo, I set out to answer:\r\n\r\nWhat are the principles we can use to build LLM-powered software that is actually good enough to put in the hands of production customers?\r\n",

I've since given a few additional conference talks ranging from technical deep dives to practical hands on advice to eng leaders about \"The New Way To Build Software\". \r\n\r\nThis talk is exciting because it blends exciting real-world demos and examples with some of the hands-on advice for how IC's and leaders should think about the coming transformation AI agents in the SDLC are going to bring.",

How can we adapt MCP for autonomous agents?\r\n- Many Common Problems: MCP is great, but what can go wrong? How can you work around it? Can the protocol be extended to solve these issues?\r\n- Monitoring Complex Phenomena: How does observability work (and not work) with MCP?\r\n- Multiple Competing Protocols: A quick run-through of other agent communication protocols like A2A and AGNTCY, and probably a few more by June 😴\r\n- Massive Crustaceans Party: What might success look like if everything goes to plan?",

These were not tenable before because of the amount of customization required per customer or per scenario, and the kind of data involved in these workflows. Previously, these workflows were driven manually which were both error prone and required expensive training. \r\n\r\nTo replace or augment these manual business critical processes, automation _has_ to cross a very high bar of reliability. \r\n\r\nWe will share how we addressed the inherent non-determinism of Gen AI to create a predictable system that doesn’t have any surprising failure modes. We’ll also discuss how we worked with our existing data that was spread across various systems without an expensive centralisation and clean up effort. ",

        "Workshop Abstract": "We've all seen website chat bots which can look up an order or answer a basic question -- but what does it take to build autonomous agents which manage long, delicate processes like multi-day medical treatments?  \r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we'll explore a workflow Stride built in partnership with Avila (https://avilascience.com/) that helps patients self-administer medication regimens at home.  The stack includes LangGraph/LangSmith, Claude, MCP, Node.js, React, MongoDB, and Twilio, and rests on a foundation of treatment \"blueprints\" which LLM-powered agents use to guide patients to good outcomes.  \r\n\r\nYou'll learn how to:\r\n-Build a hybrid system of code and prompts that leverages LLM decisioning to drive a web application, message queue and database\r\n-Design and maintain flexible agentic workflow blueprints, with no special tools (just Google Docs!)\r\n-Create an agent evaluation system, which uses LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the complexity of each interaction and escalate to human support when needed\r\n\r\nWe'll also talk about the prompt engineered guidelines and guardrails which helps agents adhere to protocol as much as possible, while gracefully handling curveballs from the patient.  Please bring questions -- we look forward to sharing our learnings on how to make agentic systems like this work in the real world!",

The vision of an \"AI Co-scientist\" – a true collaborative partner in the lab – requires sophisticated engineering to bridge the gap between powerful AI reasoning and the dynamic reality of physical experiments. This talk dives into the engineering required to build robust AI Co-scientists for hands-on research. We will explore scalable architectures, such as multi-agent systems leveraging foundation models like Gemini for complex reasoning, hypothesis refinement (inspired by the \"generate, debate, evolve\" paradigm described in recent AI Co-scientist research), and intelligent tool use. The core focus will be on the engineering challenges and solutions for integrating diverse, real-time empirical data streams – visual data from cameras, quantitative readings from sensors, positional feedback from actuators, and instrument outputs – directly into the AI's reasoning loop. I will illustrate this with concrete, technically detailed examples in chemistry (adaptive reaction monitoring), robotics (vision-guided assembly with SO Arm 100 and LeRobot library), and synthetic biology (real-time bacterial growth monitoring & interpretation). We'll discuss engineering strategies for handling data heterogeneity, latency, noise, and enabling the AI to interpret, correlate, and act upon live experimental feedback. Finally, we will touch upon how thoughtful engineering of these AI Co-scientists can contribute to democratizing access to advanced scientific capabilities.\r\n",

My PhD in Creative AI Literacies and experience at places like X Moonshot Factory and Fixie.ai give me a unique perspective on architecting AI systems that interact effectively with diverse data streams – visual, sensor, and hardware feedback – making me ideally suited to discuss the engineering hurdles and solutions for building sophisticated AI Co-scientists.\r\n\r\nI'm genuinely excited by the shift from AI as a passive analysis tool to an active, collaborative partner in scientific discovery. The true engineering challenge lies in reliably connecting powerful AI reasoning (like Gemini's) to the dynamic, often noisy, data from live experiments. This talk dives straight into that challenge, offering concrete engineering blueprints – illustrated with examples using accessible hardware like KOCH arms and Jacdac sensors in chemistry, robotics, and synthetic biology – for building AI partners that interpret and act on real-time empirical data, ultimately accelerating and democratizing research.\r\n\r\nI have a strong track record of presenting technical work effectively at conferences and research institutions, stemming from my research roles and fellowships (MIT, Weizenbaum Institute). My previous talks on AI Education at AI Engineering Summit have been successful and well-received.

However, training these agents to become experts in your product, business, and customers remains a significant challenge. But what if onboarding a digital worker was as simple as uploading your pitch deck? At 11x, we built Alice, an AI sales rep that writes outbound emails with the nuance and context of a top-performing human - because she learns like one too.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll share how we built a RAG system that lets users train Alice on their internal materials: PDFs, websites, call recordings, and more. We'll walk through our ingestion flow, OCR and chunking pipeline, and explain how we leveraged different technologies and vendors to support a wide-range of file types. We'll also discuss how we leveraged Pinecone and other vector embedding technologies to drive relevant, high-performing messaging. Finally, I'll share what we’ve learned running this system in production across 300+ customers and over 1m prospect interactions each month.",

        "Description": "Mechanistic interpretability is a frontier field that aims to reverse engineer neural networks. At Goodfire, we're operationalizing the latest in interpretability research by building Ember: the universal platform for neural programming. Ember decodes the neurons of an AI model to give direct, programmable access to its internal representations.\r\nIn this talk, we'll share more about what's unlocked by moving beyond black-box inputs and outputs, including entirely new ways to apply, train, and align AI models. We're excited for a future in which neural programming allows users to discover new knowledge hidden in their model, precisely shape its behaviors, and improve its performance. ",

        "Description": "Interpreting complex information from unstructured text data poses significant challenges to Large Language Models (LLM), with difficulties often arising from specialized terminology and the multifaceted relationships between entities in document architectures. Conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) methods face limitations in capturing these nuanced interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. In our talk, we introduce a novel approach integrating Knowledge Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) with VectorRAG, designed to refine question-answering (Q&A) systems for more effective information extraction from complex texts. Our approach employs a dual retrieval strategy that harnesses both knowledge graphs and vector databases, enabling the generation of precise and contextually appropriate answers, thereby setting a new standard for LLMs in processing sophisticated data.",
