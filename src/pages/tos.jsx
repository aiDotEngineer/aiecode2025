<li className="mb-3">all forms of Event credentials, including but not limited to badges, tickets, passes, QR codes, wristbands, and digital or mobile access credentials (collectively, “Credentials”).</li>
</ul>

<p className="mt-8">All Credentials are issued by and remain the sole property of the Organizer and may be revoked, deactivated, or denied at the Organizer’s sole discretion. Credentials are personal, non-transferable licenses, and are valid only for the individual named at the time of registration or assignment.</p>

<p className="mt-8">Unauthorized or fraudulent Credentials are strictly prohibited.<br></br>
Credentials not lawfully obtained through the Organizer or an authorized registration platform, or obtained through resale, transfer, unauthorized promotion, or duplication, are void and may be confiscated or deactivated without refund. This includes Credentials obtained via unofficial third-party vendors, resale websites, contests, or giveaways not authorized by the Organizer.</p>

<p className="mt-8">The Organizer reserves the right to:</p>

<ul className="mt-8 list-disc pl-6">
<li className="mb-3">Verify the identity and eligibility of any applicant or Credential holder at any time;</li>
<li className="mb-3">Reject, cancel, or deny any application or registration in its sole discretion, with or without cause; or</li>
<li className="mb-3">Pursue all available legal remedies against any individual or entity that submits fraudulent applications, attempts to transfer or duplicate Credentials, or otherwise violates these Terms or applicable law.</li>
</ul>

<p className="mt-8">Possession of a Credential constitutes acceptance of these Terms. Unauthorized use or attempted use of a Credential will result in immediate ejection from the Event and may result in referral to law enforcement.</p>

<p className="mt-8"><b>Refund and Revocation Policy</b></p>

<p className="mt-8">All Credentials are property of the Organizer. The Organizer may, in its sole discretion and at any time, cancel or revoke any Credentials, applications, purchases, or reservations without refund if it determines a violation of these Terms.</p>

<p className="mt-8">All payments are non-refundable, including in cases of a force majeure event (see Section 16). If the Event is cancelled in full, Participants may defer their Credentials to the next scheduled Event of the same type. In such cases, deferral is the sole and exclusive remedy. No refunds, damages, or expenses shall be paid. Postponed Events will honor the original Credentials, and no refunds or alternate remedies will be offered. Lost or stolen Credentials must be repurchased at current pricing. Credentials used by unauthorized individuals will be revoked without refund.</p>

<p className="mt-8"><b>2. Credential Transfers</b></p>

<p className="mt-8">Credentials are non-transferable once picked up or activated. Prior to pickup, Participants may request a transfer for a fee.

<p className="mt-8"><b>5. Tampering and Invalid Use</b></p>
